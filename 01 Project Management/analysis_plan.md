# HCAHPS Patient Survey Analysis Plan

We can divide our analysis to provide insights for 2 categories:

## Survey Quality
### Goal
To identify the completed survey quality and improve the effectiveness of the future surveys.

### Questions

 **Hospital participation**

* How has the number of hospitals participating in the survey trended over time? 
  * Is there a change in the participation rate over time?

* What are the number of hospitals participating in the survey in each state over time? 

  * Is there a change in the participation rate by state?

*Measurement*

*Response table* - Use of unique *Facility ID* to find the number of hospitals 

#### **Survey Completion**

* How has the completed survey distribution changed over time nationally?

* How has the completed survey distribution changed over time by state?
  * Are there any states which had the least number of completed surveys?


*Measurement*

*Response table*- Using the count of the category bins of  *Fewer than 100*, *Between 100 and 299* and *300 and above* for each state and each release period.

#### **Survey Response Rate**

* How has the survey response rate changed over time?

* What is the average national response rate? 
  * Are there any states which are above or below the average response rate?

*Measurement*

*Response table*- Use of the average of the response rate per release period

## Patient Satisfaction Quality

### Goal 
To identify the patient’s satisfaction levels nationally and statewide in terms of different measures and provide recommendations to the hospitals in underperforming states or measures to improve patient’s experience.

### Questions

**P.S**: Considering 
* Top box percentage  as Positive scores
* Bottom box percentage as Negative scores


#### **Patient’s hospital Experience based on positive and negative scorings**

* How has the patient’s average scores both positive and negative trended over time nationally?

* How has the patient’s average scores both positive and negative trended over time per state?
  * Is it above or below the national average for that year?

*Measurement*:

* *National Results table*- Using the average of the *Top Box Percentage*, *Bottom Box Percentage* per release period.
* *State Results table*- Using the average of the *Top Box Percentage*, *Bottom Box Percentage* per release period per state.

#### **Categorizing different measures**
#### **Overall patient satisfaction**

* How has the overall hospital ratings changed over different release periods nationally? 

* How has the overall hospital ratings changed over different release periods per state?
  * Is it above or below the national average for that year?

*Measurement*

* *National Results table*- Using the average of H_HSP_RATING measure per release period.
* *State Results table*- Using the average of H_HSP_RATING measure per release period per state.

#### **Hospital ratings and recommendations based on other measures**

* Does the overall hospital ratings and hospital recommendations depend upon the scoring from the other remaining measures (all remaining 8 of the measures)?
  * What is the relationship between overall hospital ratings score and other measure scores over time? 
  * Does the hospital recommendation rate/scoring increase or decrease based on a particular measure rating/scoring over time?

*Measurement*

*National Results table*- using the *top box percentage* and *bottom box percentages* for each of the measures and comparing with overall hospital rating and hospital recommendations for each release period.

## Potential Insights

* To find the release period which had the most and least hospitals participating in the surveys.
* To find the states which are most participative and least participating completing the surveys.
* To find the trends in survey response rate of patients over time.
* To find the release period having the most positive and negative patient experiences.
* To find which state had the most and least satisfied patients.
* To find the measures which received the best and the worst patient ratings each year.
* To find the year and the state which had the best and least overall patient satisfaction ratings.
* To find if the individual ratings scores of different measures have an effect on overall patient satisfaction and recommendation ratings.

## Recommendations

* Based on insights about the survey quality, we can give recommendations on:

  * How to have more hospitals participate in the surveys?

  * How to increase the survey response rate in the states participating the least?

  * How to monitor the total number of surveys completed by the patients?


* Based on the insights about patient’s experience and satisfaction, we can give recommendations on:

  * How to improve measures in the states which received the worst patient scores?

  * How to effectively design the survey questionnaire to learn more about patient scorings in different measures?

  * What potential areas can further improve the overall patient’s experience in each hospital- recognising reinforcement strategies for the best performing measures and more training regarding the worst performing measures?
